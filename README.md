## üìù About the Project

This repository serves as a **record of my problem-solving journey** on LeetCode. I‚Äôve tackled problems ranging from easy to hard, all using Python. Each solution is thoroughly explained, and I‚Äôve added comments in the code to make the approach easier to understand.

### Why Python?

Python is one of the most popular languages for coding interviews and algorithmic challenges due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive library support. In this repository, I leverage Python's power to solve problems efficiently.

## üõ† Problem Solving Approach

For each problem, I follow a structured approach:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** Carefully read the problem statement, constraints, and examples.
2. **Breaking Down the Solution:** Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
3. **Choosing the Right Data Structures:** Select the most appropriate data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets) to optimize performance.
4. **Writing the Code:** Implement the solution in Python, ensuring clarity and efficiency.
5. **Testing the Solution:** Run the solution against various test cases to ensure accuracy and performance.

### Example:

```python
# Problem: Two Sum
# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

def two_sum(nums, target):
    hashmap = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        diff = target - num
        if diff in hashmap:
            return [hashmap[diff], i]
        hashmap[num] = i
