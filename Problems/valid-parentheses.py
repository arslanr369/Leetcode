Explanation:
Stack: The stack stores opening brackets as we encounter them.
Bracket Map: The bracket_map dictionary maps each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket. This allows us to quickly check for matches.
Iterate through s:
If the character is a closing bracket, check if the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket.
If it is, pop the stack; if not, return False (the string is invalid).
If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
Final Check: After iterating through the string, if the stack is empty, the string is valid. If there are unmatched opening brackets left in the stack, the string is invalid.
